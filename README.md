#Tutedude Assignments — Module 2: Basic Python Concepts

This repository contains my Python assignments for Module 2: Basic Python Concepts from the Tutedude course.
It includes two tasks demonstrating basic programming concepts like arithmetic operations, string manipulation, input handling, and error prevention.



#Task_1— Perform Basic Mathematical Operations
   
This program demonstrates the fundamentals of arithmetic operations in Python.
It allows the user to input two numbers and then performs:

Addition → Adds the two numbers.

Subtraction → Subtracts the second number from the first.

Multiplication → Multiplies the two numbers.

Division → Divides the first number by the second, with a check to prevent division by zero.

Example Output:
Enter the first number: 10
Enter the second number: 5

--- Results ---
Addition: 15.0
Subtraction: 5.0
Multiplication: 50.0
Division: 2.0


#Task 2 — Create a Personalized Greeting
This program focuses on string manipulation and user interaction.
It asks for the user's first name and last name, combines them into a full name, and then prints a personalized greeting message.

Example Output:

Enter your first name: Fuzzy

Enter your last name: Duck

Hello, Fuzzy Duck! Welcome to the Python program!
