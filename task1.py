# Task 1: Perform Basic Mathematical Operations

# Taking two numbers as input from the user
a = float(input("Enter the first number: "))        
b = float(input("Enter the second number: "))

# Performing basic operations
addition = a + b
subtraction = a - b
multiplication = a * b
division = a / b

# Displaying results
print("\n--- Results ---")
print(f"Addition: {addition}")
print(f"Subtraction: {subtraction}")
print(f"Multiplication: {multiplication}")
print(f"Division: {division}")
